            On March 24, 2020 the state of Massachusetts went into a state of emergency with a stay-at-home advisory and the closure of all non-essential businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning that day, and continuing for over a year, I stretched a canvas in the morning and then unstretched it in the evening as I grappled with what it meant to be making art during this time. All of the staples used were collected in glass jars and sound recordings were made during the process of stretching and unstretching the canvas, as well as a log of what time of day this occurred. This process lasted until May 29, 2021 when the state of Massachusetts lifted all COVID-19 restrictions, allowing industries to reopen. The final work consists of the now tattered canvas, the canvas stretchers, the staples used, and a speaker that plays the recordings of the stretching and unstretching.
