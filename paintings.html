            <i>Unit Paintings&#8212;One, Five, Eleven</i>, 2022, is grounded in the creation of a vernacular of the visual. It is composed of units or markers that when juxtaposed and reconstructed, at once create and negate visual communication. The work consists of twelve paintings on panels that are intended to be actively reconfigured in a constant curation of new arrangements and compositions. The work can be seen as a series of eleven paintings, a single painting, or any combination of panels.
