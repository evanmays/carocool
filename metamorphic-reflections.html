              Utilizing a range of materials, <i>Folios, Stacks</i>, 2022, expands the notion of the artist book by creating a series of unbound and thus unstable material piles. These objects question the definition of physicality, objecthood, and how meaning is constantly being repositioned. The latter mimics the way our collective attention moves within a digital platform, trying to access visual culture and information. Because the pages are precariously movable, the viewer becomes a collaborator by asserting their own presence within the objects, defining juxtapositions, changing page order, and translating the relationships between the elements, thereby, creating new meaning.

            This site-specific installation, presented in the show <i>Speaking of Sculpture</i>, 2018–2019 at the Old Frog Pond Studio centers on the cycle of decay of twenty-four objects placed in and around the pond. Utilizing the shifting reflections in the water, the work probes questions of illusion, reality, and time, compounded with beautiful, yet eerie visuals of the aftermath of disaster. The work speaks to the unfolding future and the potential for ensuing dislocation and migration as a result of climate catastrophes and the felt effects of environmental degradation.
