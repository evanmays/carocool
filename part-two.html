            <i>Part Two</i>, a site-specific installation presented at the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts, in the autumn of 2020, is a meditation on the nonphysical traversing of space. In its simplest terms, the work is a reflection on how we experienced space during the global pandemic when schools and many institutional buildings were closed. It is also a deeper exploration of movement, barriers, loss, and the invisible crossing of borders, both literal and ephemeral.
